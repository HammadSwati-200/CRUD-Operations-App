Title: MUI React Data Table

Description:
This is a React data table application built using Material-UI (MUI) components. The application allows users to view, edit, and manage tabular data. It features functionalities such as adding new rows, editing existing data, and deleting rows. Data is fetched from a JSON API endpoint (https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users). The application also includes a dialog to handle input validation, ensuring all fields are filled before adding a new row. Additionally, users can view a detailed profile by clicking on the "View" button, which navigates them to a profile page using React Router. This project serves as a practical example of creating a responsive and interactive data table with Material-UI in a React application.
